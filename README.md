SmartEats – Cloud-Native Food Delivery Platform

SmartEats is a production-style microservices platform that shows how a modern food-delivery system is designed, deployed, and operated on AWS using Kubernetes and GitOps.

Built using Spring Boot, Angular, AWS EKS, RDS (MySQL), MongoDB Atlas, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and Argo CD.
